  <h1> Michelle's Game Hub
  <h4>
  <p>For my project, I was thinking about making a game hub. I already started coding a connect 4 game. This game is designed for two players but I would be interested in incorporating a bot to play with - this might require an AI component.
  <p>10/5/23: I set up the board so that the code understands when an object cannot pass through a column. I also created a circle class that allows the objects to understand whos turn it is. 
    <p>11/3/23: I made it so that when a column is clicked, the board knows whos turn it is and if the object can pass. If the object can pass, it will create a circle in the players color on the selected square.
