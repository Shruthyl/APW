  <h1>Emma Jose's Website</h1>
  <p>So far, I have been working on making a Twilio account and getting the details of that set up. Before I work on automating a text message scheduled by someone else, I feel like the best place to start is by establishing how to do it for myself. However, the one issue I have faced thus far is that I can not plug in alternate phone numbers. For some reason, it currently does not want to work, so now my next step is trouble shooting that. 
  </p>
  <p>Entry (November 3,2023): I have been studying the Twilio in and outs through their website to gain further knowledge on the topic. In addition to this, I have mastered how to send messages to my phone and others' phones, but I am facing two challenges: how to not have it say "Sent from your Twilio trial account" before every message and have the code work through the non Twilio website (when I put it into my actual pycharm and not on the Twilio website, it claims that Twilio does not exist though I had previously installed it to my library).
